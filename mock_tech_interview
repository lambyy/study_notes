know ES5 vs ES6, how to do things in both

given array of [start_time, end_time], make function merge_events(arr)
to find time blocks that are occupied
ex: [ [1, 4], [1, 2], [3, 5], [1, 4], [6, 7] ] => [ [1, 5], [6, 7] ]

steps:
  - sort array by start time
  - results array shovel in first
  - compare end times & replace as necessary
  - shovel in next event if no overlap
  - always comparing the last element in results
