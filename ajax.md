# AJAX

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML
  - uses browser XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from web server) & JavaScript/HTML DOM (to display/use data)
  - allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with web server behind the scenes, possible to update parts of web page without reloading entire page
