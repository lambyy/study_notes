## SQL vs NoSQL

### SQL (relational database)
  - structured like phonebooks, tables with defined, specified fields and columns
  - consist of rows and columns where each row is an entry and each column contains a specific type of information
  - schema necessary to define relationship between table and field types
  - data is organized, structured and defined to minimize redundancy and prevent tables from being out of sync
  - good for ACID compliance (atomicity consistency isolation durability) - necessary for ecommerce & financial applications to reduce anomalies and protect database integrity
  - usually used when data is structured and unchanging

### NoSQL (non-relational database)
  - document oriented/distributed, folders that hold any related data
  - data requirements not clearly defined, unstructured data
  - non-structured data stored in a single document that can be easily found but is not categorized into fields
  - more intuitive but requires extra processing and storage
  - sacrifices ACID for flexibility and processing speed
  - has no limit on types of data to store together
  - good for rapid development
