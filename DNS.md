DNS - Domain Name System

architecture for how to pair a domain name with an IP address

- user asks browser to visit URL
- browser queries DNS resolver "where is URL?" if not cached
- DNS resolver queries Root servers "where is .COM" -->  Verisign
- DNS resolver queries Verisign "where is URL?" --> name server & IP address
- hosting servers queried with IP address
- website files delivered and rendered on user page
